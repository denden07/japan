UI/UX:

I choose this design because i want user to use the web app easily. 
I've been researching alot of travel web apps and i took inspiration on some of the sites i visited. 
Their sites are easy to use and so i think that my design is also user friendly given the development time is short.


Code Implementation:

I have commented the most important things in my code and i write them so that the reviewers can understand how the code works.
